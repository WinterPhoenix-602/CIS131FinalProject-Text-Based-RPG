# CIS131Final-Project

This project is a fairly barbones text-based rpg, played entirely by picking options from menus by inputting numbers corresponding to presented options.
To get started, you can wither load a saved file from the load selection screen accessable by pressing 2, or begin a new game by pressing 1. As of yet, 
You can only travel between the beginning plains and a single combat encounter to the north. Let me know if you encounter any errors just messing around with it,
It will be helpful to have some people testing it, if you're up for it.
