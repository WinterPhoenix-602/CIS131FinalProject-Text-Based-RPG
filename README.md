# CIS131Final-Project

This project is a fairly barebones text-based rpg, played by inputting numbers corresponding to options presented in various menus.
To get started, you can either load a save file from the load selection screen accessible by pressing 2, or begin a new game by pressing 1. As of yet, you can only travel between the beginning plains and a single combat encounter to the north. Let me know if you encounter any errors while messing around with it, it would be helpful to have some people testing it.
